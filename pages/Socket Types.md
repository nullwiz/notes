- # [[SOCK_STREAM]]
  -> Typically used for Stream I/O with a remote socket
  -> Same concept that applies to unix pipe. Bytes written at the end of pipe, are received at the other end as continuous
  stream of bytes.
  -> No boundaries, no record length, no block size, no concept of "packet" at receiving end
  -> Whatever data is currently available at the receiving end is returned in the caller's buffer
  -> Guaranteed order of data at receiving end, If failure, error is reported and recovery attempts are automatic
- # [[SOCK_DGRAM]]
  -> Not particularly reliable
  -> Used in situations where data is not absolutely required to be in sequence at the remote end
  -> Packets might be lost, no attempt to recover
  -> Datagram packets have size limits
  -> Packets sent in unconnected manner, permits a program to address its message to a different remote process with each message written to the same socket
